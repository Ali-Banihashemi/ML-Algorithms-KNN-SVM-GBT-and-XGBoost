# Machine Learning Algorithms: KNN, SVM, GBT, and XGBoost

This repository contains projects demonstrating the implementation and explanation of key machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). These projects showcase my understanding and skills in applying these algorithms to various datasets using Python.

This was done for the AI course in 2024 at the University of Tehran under the instruction of Professor Khoshnevisan.
